# 🌟 Tanjore Degree Coffee — Website Redesign  
**📅 Duration:** April 2025 – May 2025  
**🧑‍💻 Internship:** Shadow Fox Web Development Internship  
**🚀 Live Project:** [shadowfox-internship-client-project.vercel.app](https://shadowfox-internship-client-project.vercel.app)

I had the privilege of redesigning the digital home of **Tanjore Degree Coffee**, a beloved brand known for its authentic South Indian filter coffee and refreshing rose milk. Our mission was to blend **tradition with technology**—crafting a minimalist yet modern web experience that pays tribute to the brand’s rich legacy.

This website redesign features:

- 🌐 **Smooth parallax scrolling** for a dynamic and immersive browsing experience  
- ✨ **Interactive hover effects and animated buttons** to enhance user engagement  
- 📱 **Fully responsive layouts**, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop users  
- 🎥 **Visual storytelling** with curated images and video content  
- ⚡ **Performance optimizations** for lightning-fast loading speeds  
- 🔍 **Basic SEO integration** for better search engine discoverability  

> My goal was to build a digital experience as rich and memorable as a cup of Tanjore Degree Coffee itself. ☕
